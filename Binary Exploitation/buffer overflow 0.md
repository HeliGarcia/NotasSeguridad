# buffer overflow 0

## Descripción
Smash the stack Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/172/vuln). You can view source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/172/vuln.c). And connect with it using: `nc saturn.picoctf.net 63397`

## Pistas
- How can you trigger the flag to print?
- If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
- Run `man gets` and read the BUGS section. How many characters can the program really read?

## Solución
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/picoCTF/exploitation/overflow]
└─$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 63397
Input: pero como es posible que no funcione estoooooo
